    <h2>What is Cisco?</h2>
    <h3>Cisco is cyber patriot terms is Cisco Packet Tracer or just Packet Tracer.<br> Cisco Packet Tracer is a device based netowrking simulator. It allows users to simulate a network and edit configurations without phyical devices.</h3>
    <h3>In Cyber Patriots you will use Packet Tracer to configure IP address, VLAN's, Subnet masks, DNS, and Configuring Terminal. </h3>
    <h3>Packet Tracer is an actual part of the competions, they will earn you points and in high school can lead to entire careers.<br> Cisco Packet Tracer is not something that a lot of teams can afford to just forget about and not use. </h3>

    <h2>What is an IP address?</h2>
    <h3>An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to the internet, essentially acting as a digital address that allows devices to communicate with each other by identifying their location on the network; it's like a "mailing address" for data on the internet. </h3>
    <h3>An example of an IP address is: 147.168.3.1</h3>
    <h3>There are 2 types of IP addresses: <br><br>IPv4:<br>147.168.3.1<br><br>IPv6:<br>2001:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888<br><br>You will mostly see IPv4 in Cisco Packet Tracer.</h3>
    <h3>With this I will focus on IPv4. Each part of a IP address has a diffrent purpose.<br> For anything here we will use 147.168.3.1 as our example IP address.</h3>
    <h3>We're going to focus on the first three numbers in the IP address. This is the 147.168.3 part. <br>This is known as the network address. This is used to find the network the device is connected to. Without this you wouldn't be able to connect to anything not on your own network.</h3>
    <h3>The next part is the last number. This is the .1 part at the end. This is your Host ID. This is to allow other devices to identify each other on the same network. <br>For exapmle, if you have 2 devices on the same network one device might have an IP address of 147.168.3.1 while the other device has a 147.168.3.2 </h3>
