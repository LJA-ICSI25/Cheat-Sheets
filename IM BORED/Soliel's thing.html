    <h2>Password Policy</h2>
    <p>To change the password policy on Windows 11, you can use the Local Group Policy Editor or the Command Prompt, depending on what aspect of the password policy you want to modify. Here's how to do it using both methods:</p>
    <h3>Method 1: Using Local Group Policy Editor</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Local Group Policy Editor</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box.</li>
                <li>Type "gpedit.mcs" and press enter or click OK.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Navigate to Password Policy:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Local Group Policy Editor, go to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Password Policy</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Edit the Password Policy</li>
            <ul>
                <li>On the right-hand side, you'll see several password policy options. You can modify the following:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enforce password history: Set the number of unique passwords the system will remember before allowing reuse.</li>
                        <li>Maximum password age: Set how long a password can be used before it must be changed.</li>
                        <li>Minimum password age: Set how long a password must be in use before it can be changed.</li>
                        <li>Minimum password length: Set the minimum number of characters a password must contain.</li>
                        <li>Password must meet complexity requirements: Enable or disable password complexity (e.g., requiring uppercase letters, numbers, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Store passwords using reversible encryption: Enable or disable reversible encryption for passwords.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Apply Changes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>After making your changes, close the Local Group Policy Editor.</li>
                <li>You may need to run the following command in an elevated Command Prompt to enforce the changes:<br>gpupdate /force</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Method 2: Using Command Prompt (secpol.mcs)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Local Security Policy</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press Windows + R, type secpol.mcs and press enter or click OK. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Navigate to Password Policy:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Local Security Policy window, go to: Account Policies > Password Policy</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Modify the Password Policies (It's the same options as Method 1)</li>
        <li>Apply Changes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Once you modify the policies, close the Local Security Policy window.</li>
                <li>To apply the changes immediately, run: <br>gpupdate /force</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you're on a Home edition of Windows 11, the Group Policy Editor might not be available. In that case, you can use the Registry Editor to modify some password settings, but that approach is less user-friendly and is not recommended for beginners.</li>
        <li>For more advanced configurations or enterprise environments, you might also want to configure Active Directory policies if applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Lockout Policy</h2>
    <p>To change the account lockout policy on Windows 11, you can use the Local Group Policy Editor or Local Security Policy. The lockout policy defines how many failed login attempts are allowed before a user account is locked out and how long the lockout lasts.</p>
    <h3>Method 1: Using Local Group Policy Editor</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Group Polciy Editor</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box</li>
                <li>Type gpedit.msc and press Enter or click OK</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Navigate to the Account Lockout Policies</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Local Group Policy Editor, go to: Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Modify the Lockout Policies<br>You will see several options in the Account Lockout Policy section:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Account lockout duration: This sets how long an account will remain locked after reaching the failed login attempts limit. Set it to the desired time (in minutes).</li>
                <li>Account lockout threshold: This specifies the number of failed login attempts allowed before an account is locked. You can set this value to your preferred number of attempts (e.g., 3).</li>
                <li>Reset account lockout counter after: This defines the time period in minutes that must pass before the failed login attempt counter is reset. For example, if you set it to 15 minutes, the counter will reset after 15 minutes of no failed login attempts.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Set the Policies:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Double-click on each of these settings to open the configuration window and set the values you want. For example, to change the account lockout threshold to 3 attempts, double-click Account lockout threshold, select the number of failed attempts, and click OK.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Apply the changes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Once you make your changes, close the Group Policy Editor. The policies should take effect immediately, but you may need to run the following command in an elevated Command Prompt to ensure that the changes are applied: <br>gpupdate /force </li>
            </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>Method 2: Using Local Security Policy (secpol.msc)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Local Security Policy</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Press Windows + R, type secpol.msc, and press Enter or click OK.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Navigate to Account Lockout Policies</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Local Security Policy window, go to: Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Edit the Lockout Policies</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You will see the following policies</li>
                <li>Account lockout duration</li>
                <li>Account lockout threshold</li>
                <li>Reset account lockout counter after</li>
                <li>DOuble-click each policy to modify it's settings (Similar to what you would do in Group Policy Editor.)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Apply the Changes:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>After making the changes, close the Local Security Policy window.</li>
                <li>If you want the changes to take affect immediately, run the following command: <br>gpupdate /force</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you set Account lockout threshold to 0, account lockout will be disabled, meaning no account lockout will occur after failed login attempts.</li>
        <li>Be careful when modifying lockout policies in a production or business environment, as setting too low of a threshold can lock out users who make several typos when logging in, while setting too high of a threshold might make accounts more vulnerable to brute-force attacks.</li>
    </ul>

        </ol>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Check Groups</h2>
    <p>To check user groups on Windows 11, you can use several methods depending on whether you want to view group memberships for a specific user, or if you simply want to view all the groups on the system. Here are the main ways to check groups:</p>
    <h3>Method 1: Using Settings (for Basic Group Memberships)</h3>
    <p>While Settings doesn’t provide a direct way to view all groups, it does show group memberships for user accounts, specifically whether an account is an Administrator or Standard User.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Settings:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press Windows + I to open Settings</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Go to Accounts</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the left sidebar, click on Accounts</li>
        </ul>
        <li>View User Type</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Under the Your info section, you can see whether you’re signed in with a Microsoft account or a local account, and your account type (either Administrator or Standard User).</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>For more detailed group membership info, you would need to use other methods.</p>
    <h3>Method 2: Using Control Panel (for Viewing Groups)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Control Panel</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box</li>
            <li>Type control and press Enter</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Go to User Accounts</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Control Panel, click on User Accounts, then Manage another account.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Manage Groups</li>
        <ul>
            <li>From here, you can view user accounts and their associated group memberships. However, this method is somewhat limited, and you won’t see detailed group memberships directly.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Method 3: Using Local Users and Groups (lusrmgr.msc)</h3>
    <p>If you're using Windows 11 Pro or higher, the Local Users and Groups manager is the most effective way to view all groups and their members.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Local Users and Groups:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box</li>
            <li>Type lusrmgr.msc and Press Enter. This opens the Local Users and Groups window.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>View Groups:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Local Users and Groups window, click on the Groups folder on the left hand side. This will shows a list of all local gorups on the system.</li>
            <li>You can click on any group (e.g., Administrator, Users, Guests) to view the members of that group.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add/Remove Group Members:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To see the members of a specific group, double-click on it, and a list of the members will appear. You can also add or remove users from these groups by clicking Add or Remove. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Method 4: Using Command Promt (To View User's Groups Memberships)</h3>
    <p>You can use Command Prompt to view the groups associated with a user account</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Command Prompt</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press Windows + X and select Command Prompt (Admin) or Windows Terminal (Admin)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Check User's Group Memberships</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To view the groups a specific user is a part of, use the following command: <br>net user username</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Replace username with the actual name of the user account.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The output will show you details about the user account, including the list of groups that the user belongs to (look under “Local Group Memberships”).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method 5: Using Powershell (To View All Groups)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Powershell</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press Windows + X and select Windows Powershell (Admin) </li>
        </ul>
        <li>List All Groups</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To view all groups on the system, run this command: <br> Get-LocalGroup</li>
            <li>This will list all the local groups on your computer</li>
        </ul>
        <li>View Members of a specific group</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To view the members of a specific group, use: <br>Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "GroupName" <br>Replace "GroupName" with the name of the group, such as "Administrators" or "Users". </li>
        </ul>
        <li>View Groups for a Specific User:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To check the groups that a specific user belongs to, use: <br> Get-LocalUser | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "username" } | Get-LocalGroup</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Replace "username" with the actual name of the user account.</p>
    <h3>Method 6: Using Task Manager (for Active Users)</h3>
    <p>If you want to view which user accounts are logged in and some of their group information:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Task Manager</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager</li>
        </ul>
        <li>View Users</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to the Users tab to see active users. While this doesn’t show specific groups, you can see which users are logged in.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Key Points</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Local Groups: Common groups include Administrators, Users, Guests, etc.</li>
        <li>Built-In Groups: You cannot delete or modify some groups like Administrators or Guests, but you can add or remove users from them.</li>
        <li>Windows 11 Home: If you’re on Windows 11 Home, some of the more advanced  tools like Local Users and Groups (lusrmgr.msc) are not available. You would need to rely on Command Prompt or PowerShell for advanced group management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UAC (User Account Control)</h2>
    <p>To turn User Account Control (UAC) to the maximum level on Windows 11, follow these steps:</p>
    <h3>Method 1: Using the Control Panel</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Control Panel</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog</li>
            <li>Type control and press Enter</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Navigate to User Account Control Settings</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Control Panel, go to System and Security > Security and Maintenance > Change User Account Control settings (on the left side).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Set UAC to the maximum level</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the User Account Control Settings window, you’ll see a slider with four levels:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Never notify</li>
                <li>Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (default)</li>
                <li>Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (do not dim my desktop)</li>
                <li>Always notify (this is the highest level, and it will prompt you every time an app tries to install software or make changes to your PC)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Move the Slider to "Always Notify"</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To set UAC to the maximum level, move the slider to Always notify (the top-most option)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Click OK</li>
        <ul>
            <li>After selecting Always notify, click OK to apply the changes</li>
            <li>You may need to restart your computer for the settings to take effect</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Method 2: Using Local Group Policy Editor (Windows 11 Pro or Higher)</h3>
    <p>If you’re using Windows 11 Pro, you can also configure UAC settings through the Local Group Policy Editor</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Local Group Policy Editor</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog</li>
            <li>Type gpedit.msc and press Enter</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Navigate to UAC policies:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Local Group Policy Editor, go to</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > User Account Control</p>
        <li>Modify UAC Policies</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Double-click on the policy called User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode</li>
                <li>Ensure it is set to Enabled to enforce UAC behavior</li>
                <li>There are other settings under User Account Control that can modify how UAC behaves, such as</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators (set this prompt for consent to get the maximum UAC experince) </li>
                        <li>User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users (this can be set to prompt for consent to reqire a password every time)</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Apply the changes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>After modifying the settings, close the Local Group Policy Editor</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Method 3: Using Registry Editor (Advanced)</h3>
    <p>If you want to manually change UAC settings in the registry (use with caution), you can do so in the registry editor</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Registry Editor</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Press Windows + R, type regedit, and press Enter</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Navigate to the UAC Registry Keys:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the Registry Editor, Navigate to the following path</li>
                </ul>
                <p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System</p>
            <li>Modify the UAC Settings</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for the EnableLUA key. This controls whether UAC is enabled</li>
                    <li>Ensure that value is set to 1 (this controls UAC)</li>
                    <li>ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin: Set this to 2 for "Prompt for consent" (This is the most stringent settings)</li>
                    <li>ConsentPromptBehaviorUser: Set this to 3 for "Prompt for credentials" for standard users</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Restart the computer</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>After making these changes, restart your computer for them to take effect.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>UAC Notifications: When set to “Always notify,” Windows will prompt you whenever an app tries to install software or make changes to your computer, even if you’re logged in as an administrator.</li>
            <li>Security: Increasing the UAC level can improve security by requiring more frequent user consent before changes are made to the system. However, it may also be more intrusive, especially when installing software or modifying system settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
