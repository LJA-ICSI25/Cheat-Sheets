        <h2>How This Page Works:</h2>
        <p>This has been an ongoing project for me and I'm trying to move everything into one now. It might take a while but hopefully I will get this done soon.</p>
        <p>There are no images to keep it small, but all necessary information is included.</p>
        <p>I know some parts aren't done but I'm trying my best to get them all done. As I work on them I will update it for everyone else. </p>
        <p><strong>Better displayed on a laptop or desktop. Not designed for phones/tablets.</strong></p>
        <hr>

        <h2><strong>Rules</strong></h2>
        <h3>There are three important rules:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Consult a coach or teammate first.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Do not edit my code. I worked hard on these, so don't mess them up.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Please don't just copy my stuff and pass it as your own. I worked hard and I deserve my work.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have any issues, use the "About Me" page to contact me.</p>
